# There are several ways to display transaction results in a friendly way:
#
#     show_result(rsp)
#
# .. which is equivalent to:
#
#     show(TransactionResult(rsp))
#
# .. or, if you want to navigate the relations explicitly:
#
#     for relation in result.relations
#         show(relation)
#     end
